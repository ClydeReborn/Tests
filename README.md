# Clyde Tests
A set of scripts used to test out, whether the provider you've selected will actually work.

## Available Tests
You have two options to test Clyde:
- [Quick Test](https://github.com/ClydeReborn/Tests/blob/master/test_clyde_quick.py)
- [Comprehensive Test](https://github.com/ClydeReborn/Tests/blob/master/test_clyde_quick.py)

The quick test will run each provider only once, returning very basic results.<br>
The comprehensive test will run all providers 10 times, it will give you reports on stability, errors and the outputs given.

Be aware the comprehensive test may take a longer time to finish, you should use it instead of the quick test for the best results.<br>
After you are done testing, plug in your working provider of choice back into [Clyde](https://github.com/ClydeReborn/Clyde) and get it running, enjoy!
